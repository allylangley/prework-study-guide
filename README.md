# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was built as a resource for bootcamp students to reference as they move through the course so they can recall important information about key topics. By building this study guide, I learned how HTML, CSS and JavaScript all worked together to make functioning webpages that I'm used to seeing and they all have very different, but equally important, roles.

## Usage

There are four sections of this study guide containing notes that cover a different topic. Since JavaScript is running, you can navigate to the DevTools console to see the list of topics that were reviewed in the prework. It will choose one of topics for you to study first.
